Cross Cutting of network
Security as enpoints exposed

Middleware - Orchestration
Handling of Enterpise API Management. 
Apagee - opensource 

Light-weight mediator - centralized managed.
?? North-bound && south-bound Api?

Why was this not possible before?
ENVOY Proxy - uild on lYft -> performed close to application. Single , FILTER Chains , Layer 4 to Layer 7 concerns
Capabilites: HTTP/2, gRPC

SERVICE MESH LANDSCAPE
Coordination and Service Discovery
Remote Procedure Call
Service Proxy
API Gateway
Service Mesh
Monitoring
Loging
Tracing
Class Engineering

SERVICE MESH INTERFACE :
Concerns : Noth, South concers 
Gamma is the successor of the SMIs as gateways are there.

Kuma
Kuma is non-service
Simplified Multi-node support : Multi-zone and standalone.

??Control Plane Redundancy
Kuma - control plane
Mothership - has the configurations
Global - right config so zonal cp can push the relevant info to data planes

Zone is an abstraction.

OPPORTUNITIES IN MODERN ARCHITECTURE
Bounded context and tentant reosurces
While exerting centrlaized governance
And shared services : Monitoring, observaility for SRE/Platform , Teamss
Scale to enterpise requirements


KUMA INSTALLATION
KUMA GUI

ZERO TRUST - when one pod is communication to another.
?? port-forward


Key Store
trust Store
Build in CA - provides certificates to side-car
?? sidecar
We can also build CAs

OBSERVABILITY
TRAFFIC TRACE : JAEGER COLLECTOR - Standard processed to use to collect the traces
Traces are visual represntation of call.: Traffic went through services

?? Traces vs logs  : performances vs details log 
TODO : open telemetry 
Traces will also come when
