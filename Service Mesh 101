Cross Cutting of network
Security as enpoints exposed

Middleware - Orchestration
Handling of Enterpise API Management. 
Apagee - opensource 

Light-weight mediator - centralized managed.
?? North-bound && south-bound Api?

Why was this not possible before?
ENVOY Proxy - uild on lYft -> performed close to application. Single , FILTER Chains , Layer 4 to Layer 7 concerns
Capabilites: HTTP/2, gRPC

SERVICE MESH LANDSCAPE
Coordination and Service Discovery
Remote Procedure Call
Service Proxy
API Gateway
Service Mesh
Monitoring
Loging
Tracing
Class Engineering

SERVICE MESH INTERFACE :
Concerns : Noth, South concers 
Gamma is the successor of the SMIs as gateways are there.

Kuma
Kuma is non-service
Simplified Multi-node support : Multi-zone and standalone.

??Control Plane Redundancy
Kuma - control plane
Mothership - has the configurations
Global - right config so zonal cp can push the relevant info to data planes

Zone is an abstraction.

OPPORTUNITIES IN MODERN ARCHITECTURE
Bounded context and tentant reosurces
While exerting centrlaized governance
And shared services : Monitoring, observaility for SRE/Platform , Teamss
Scale to enterpise requirements
